## Getting Started with Relational Database

In this project, I get started to use Oracle RDBMS.
First tables were created and loded data to them, followed by quering and updating tables.

# Dataset: https://github.com/smkandel/Database-Project/tree/main/Soccer

# Steps:
1. For the European Soccer database, tables were created using create table statements for following: COUNTRY, LEAGUE, MATCH, PLAYER, PLAYER_ATTRIBUTES, TEAM, TEAM_ATTRIBUTES.
2. Schema Diagram was created using create statements.
3. Python programming was used to load data records into the tables created.
4. Executed 3 more Insert commands that attempt to insert 3 more records to violate the integrity constraints.
5. Executed 3 sql command to Delete a record that violates a referential integrity constraint. 
6. Inserted three new records that do not violate any integrity constraints.
